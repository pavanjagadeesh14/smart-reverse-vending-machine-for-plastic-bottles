# smart-reverse-vending-machine-for-plastic-bottles
An Arduino-based  Reverse Vending Machine for plastic bottles using sensors and coin rewards
This project is an embedded system using Arduino UNO, IR sensors, RFID, and a coin dispenser to encourage eco-friendly plastic recycling.
## Features
- Accepts and detects PET plastic bottles
- Weighs bottles and rewards users with coins
- User recognition via RFID
- Compact and low-cost model using Arduino UNO
## Technologies Used
- Arduino UNO
- IR Sensor
- Load Cell + HX711
- RFID Reader (RC522)
- LCD Display
- Servo Motor
- Coin Hopper
- Solar Panel
## How it Works
1. User places a bottle into the machine.
2. Bottle is detected and weighed.
3. If valid, a coin is dispensed.
4. Bottle is stored, and data is recorded.
